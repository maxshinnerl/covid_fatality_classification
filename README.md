A Machine Learning Exploration of COVID-19 Data

The purpose of this project is to build a binary classification model to a dataset of COVID-positive people, trying to predict whether or not the person's case resulted in death (predicting label column 'death_yn').  The codebase and machine learning process can be found in model_fitting.ipynb.

Using Random Forest Classifiers and hyperparameter searching through Random Cross Validation, I achieved a balanced accuracy score of ~90%, roughly 24% higher than the initial Logistic Regression model.
